# coree: Memory and Code Intelligence

You are using **coree**, which provides persistent memory and code intelligence across sessions.

The coree plugin injects relevant memories and code context automatically at the
start of each session and on every prompt. Treat that injected context as
background - act on it, and use the tools below to dig deeper and to store new findings.

## Core Capabilities

- **Memory Subsystem**: Stores decisions, gotchas, and architectural discoveries.
- **Code Intelligence**: Unified search over source code and git history.

## Primary Tool: `search`

**Use `search` as your primary entry point.**

- It performs a hybrid search across both memories and source code.
- Use it before starting a task to see if there is prior context.
- Use it to find symbols or architectural patterns in the codebase.
- Use `get_symbol` for exact symbol lookups instead of reading whole files.

## Memory Hygiene

To keep your memory useful, store findings as they occur:

- **Decisions**: When you make an architectural choice.
- **Gotchas**: When something didn't work as expected or had a non-obvious cause (`importance >= 0.8`).
- **How-it-works**: After exploring a new subsystem.
- **Facts**: Stable information about the project.

Use `store_memories` to save these findings. Store inline as you work - do not defer to the end of the session.
